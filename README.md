# Analysing-a-Dataset-of-LEGO-Pieces
Learn to Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces.

we're going to be diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO, which will help us answer a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

- What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

- In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many did the company sell when it first launched?

- Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

- When did the LEGO company take off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

- Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

## learning:

- use HTML Markdown in Notebooks, such as section headings # and how to embed images with the <img> tag.

- combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data

- use the .value_counts() function

- slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

- use the .agg() function to run an operation on a particular column

- rename() columns of DataFrames

- create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.

- create a scatter plot in Matplotlib

- work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys

- .merge() DataFrames along a particular column

- create a bar chart with Matplotlib
